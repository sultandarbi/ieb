the idea here is..

the walet will be check the orginlity of coin
so, if any one like to send money from his ewalte to another walet, reciver walet will check if this walet is OK or not
if is OK make transfer, if no't don't

easy way

the walet will issued from the orginal site only "IEB" only
and when bank issue new coins all walets in the world will know about it and the secert codes..

for example
in 10 Feb 2019 bank issue 1000 coins each one equals 1gr of 24kirat of Gold.
each coin had hash no #code for example (002939ff03034040)
so, if any one hade this coin in his walet then he like to send it to another one the walet send the data(#code) to 
reciver walet with other data such as date , time of issued, and make check with the the #code no , so if any thing is ok.
eccepet the coin , other wise , refuse to eccepet this coin.
of course all data and information will be secet and hashed, so no one know about issu date or the cod or any thing
only the walet have the naccery data.
